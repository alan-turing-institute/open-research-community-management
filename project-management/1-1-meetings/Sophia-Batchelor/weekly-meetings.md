## Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### 📍 Check-in ritual
(Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs)

### Project specific Reflection

* External Comms Channels (Teams Group) 
	* Talked to REG team, IT, and other groups who set up special interest groups to better understand if it's what we need
	* Got clarity over how to set up linked docs with external collaborators in Teams 
	* This lays the foundation for better understanding what to set up for a shared calendar, shared file system for non-github data, and comms channels.
* Stakeholder mapping
	* Some extensive set up is needed, but we found a way to collaborate and share the documents we've all been working on separately
* Documentation
	* I realized there is currently a fail point due to not having a central hub for communication and information that is used by everyone which may be a large factor into why I get pinged more than is sustainable. 
	* I want to figure out a way to shift work towards documentation to get that knowledge captured but currently am unsure what blocks to move off my plate. 
* Roadmap/Goal Posts 
	* The unsurity of what we're meant to be aiming at has been taking a toll on all folks. 


### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* KW suggested that we could explore better support folk by working collaboratively on AIM PPIE, which would alleviate some of the work pieces on my plate and allow me to get to documentation. Chatted with AL about this and would love clarity on how to do this "the right way".

### 📍 Check-in ritual
* DC away, EG away
* **Ethics/Focus Groups:** no word back but unofficial channels said that many of the people are on leave and back towards the end of August (when the next meeting is happening so hope to hear then). 
* **PPIE September Events** 3 of the 4 events have been confirmed and placed on people's calendars.

### Project specific Reflection

* Internal comms needs addressing. 

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Teams vs Slack. It feels like we're getting a large push back from people about Slack, but Turing can't set up a Teams Team (it would have to be one of the folk at Swansea or Edinburgh.

## Date: 12 July 2022 

### 📍 Check-in ritual

#### Project specific Reflection

* Last week we chatted about having a sync meeting: the Ops meeting on Thursday served that in terms of updates, and EZ and I also grabbed DC on Thursday for a chit chat 🚀 
* EZ is taking lead on the GitHub workshop next week, they're an absolute rockstar and I'm super grateful that it's taken off my plate. 
* There's one call that needed to be rescheduled, but I've now met with 19 PPIE leads/co-applicants over the past 3 weeks 🚀 
* Overall I think internal comms were really good last week. 
* There's enough to tackle locally right now, but I do need to be chipping away at building external connections to communities as the conference has been mentioned a few times in the past week.
	* EK - you are relient on the stakeholder mapping - check in with the progress of this and see if it can be shared with you for checking progress and additions from you as well.  

#### Notes to discuss during 1:1

## Date: 5 July 2022

### 📍 Check-in ritual
(Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs)

#### Project specific Reflection

* Massive shout out to DC for getting the NIHR report across the finish line (side question: how is the appreciations channel used? I couldn't quite figure it out based on the posts). 
* We've been meeting with the consortia in a PPIE capacity and there's great insights into how we can support them. 
* The website is not up yet (needs 2-3 days work to put the content in) which creates a small blocker for internal comms. 
* Trying to work with Turing's comms team to get videos out to the consortia about sessions - the 2.4GB meetings just won't attach on an email. 
	* EK - video uploading is a blocker for all CMs at the moment so you might want to use sharepoint now while you wait for that to happen. 

#### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Updates from LC's 1:1 as we head into academic summer 
* Discussing what help/support I can give the consortia within the remit
	* EK - let's speak to DC about LC capacity. 
* Unravelling the people resources for PPIE boards.  
	* EK - how many people, what their capacity is to sit on 1 or more boards. What positions you need - number of boards and number of people needed on them. Timeframe for this happening? 
* What task management tools do you use across your projects? (just brain storming would be fab) 
	* EK - Todoist for long term tracking of different project tasks - I also use paper lists and constantly update them.  

### 📚 Updates

* ✅ Met with LC about summer plans and work packages
* ✅ Met with 2 further consortia
* ✅ Protected the main branches. 

#### What did you struggle with?

* I am 3 meetings behind on notes - I did the meeting recordings but just haven't caught back up. 
* Bandwidth is being taken up by the big meaty strategy tasks. Not a bad thing, just an acknowledgement that there's really important work in capturing the outcomes and learnings from meetings and work pieces that takes time to deep think about. 
* Haven't had mental/bug solving space to get the Hugo site up. Need to timeblock but there's been higher priority things, but not having that site is also creating some blocks (especially with event comms). 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Polish off the ethics and submit 🚀
* OLS Application 
* Meeting notes 
* Leading PPIE Lunchtime session 
* Prep for RSF Operations Meeting

	* A session I ran recently as [Github basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVsYTv4CG14)

#### Any other topics

## Date: 22 June 2022

### Check-in ritual
☀️😎 Sunny days make for good vibes. 

### Project specific Reflection

**Based on last week's work plan** (see more in [achievements](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building/edit/main/project-management/1-1-meetings/Sophia-Batchelor/weekly-meetings.md#what-did-you-achieve)):
* DC and EB are working away at the NIHR report. I've sent some details on specific work tasks DC's way and offered help for whenever it's needed. PPIE lead is still away, but DC and EB have indicated that they don't have specific asks yet. 
* External AIM-RSF website is almost up and running (have been making content changes based off suggestions from a Monday afternoon meeting) and is a priority for this week ahead of events coming up. 

**PPIE & Constortia Meetings**  
* Have been meeting with PPIE leads 1:1 and starting having larger meetings with Consortia leads (with DC & MF) that have provided so much insight!! This has been 2 weeks in the works getting set up. 

**GitHub & Community Building work** 
* Have been supporting EZ with collating GitHub training materials while also doing bitty tasks with the repositories (CoC's, Project boards, GitHub Actions, Issues, Onboarding, reviewing PR's etc). 
* ⚠️ Ran into a major blocker that EB has flagged around IT, GitHub, and Slack. As of today, we are continuing ahead as it's for the higher ups to figure out.  
* 🤦 Had issues with cross-consortia comms, email invites, and meeting links so no one showed up to Evelina's talk. We've set out a bit of a plan for how to approach this in the future. 
	* EK - thanks for flagging these issues. 	 


### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Run through the updates.
* The upcoming changes to Slack & GitHub Collaboration. 
* Channels of communication that your projects have used successfully. 


#### Who did you help this week?

* Supported a cross-consortia meeting and took notes with EZ & MM for DC. 
* Connected MM to TTW Community and curated resources/had a discussion about attributions and authorship. 
* DC with creating his first GitHUb repository. 
* EG & EZ with setting up the Hugo site. 
* AS/TTW with reviewing the June newsletter. 

#### Who helped you this week?

* EK with the template ethics form, ✍️ and others with confirmation of what forms to use and where to find guidance. 
* EB with a super insightful meeting on the RoPA forms and GDPR. 
* EZ and MM with collaborative notes (we stayed far after the end of the work day trying to understand them)
* DC & MF with taking the lead during meetings and being fantastic folks to work with (& learn from). 
* Markus & others in REG (ask away channel) debugging some homebrew issues (and shout out to JD for some preliminary discussion). 
* DC & EB with outstanding awesomeness (they're just great folk to work with and make things easy).


#### What did you achieve?

* Ethics forms were figured out (thanks to EK & others). The blank template has been uploaded into the GitHub repo. 
* Got the probation statements in Cezanne and signed off 🎉 
* Finished the recent batch of HR forms.  
* Met with 3 PPIE leads across various projects. 
* Met with EZ and planned application for OLS (meeting notes [here](https://hackmd.io/@brainonsilicon/BJKABhaY5)). 
* Collated some resources for EZ on TTW's GitHub introduction and workshops and started creating a [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YTukVAA98J9kgpZcSHWgMh8R3jB5sHoO7OJt2abRn0Y/edit?usp=sharing) tailored to the consortium members.
* I've been exploring WelcomeBots and what's best to set up for the AIM-RSF community. 
* I've been on calls with various folks exploring various features on GitHub (Projects, Issues, Discussions, and GitHub Actions to link them all together) and getting them quickly onboarded into the project work that is immediately due. 
* Uploaded a starter Glossary of Terms to the GitHub repository and opened a discussion with Eirini (and others) to have around making the list easy to use.

	* EK - All great work - very happy that you and EZ are applying to OLS6.  

#### What did you struggle with?

* **Overwhlem** Feeling a smidge overwhelmed as some tasks are taking longer than expected this past week. Trying to keep working hours is proving a bit hard as I feel guilty about not getting things done in the expected timeframe (i.e. noticed lots of typos in the ethics form and some of the questions were different than the TREx approach so it's still an open task). 
* **Keeping track of tasks.** I need to rebuild up some form of task tracking system as I'm getting pings for small requests that I can do, but forget what they're related to and need to move on to the next thing. 
* **Summary Email/Notes** I fell out of habit writing end of day summaries last week so had a monster job on friday pulling it all together into an email and sending it out (was favouring getting to bed early as I'm up early on some calls with California last week and this). I've picked the daily logs back up this week but not having sent out that email (and even just curating it for myself) have left a massive gap in internal comms.  

	* EK - you are doing great so try not to feel overwhelmed - you are progressing on tasks so making progress. Project boards sounds like a good future plan for task tracking. Summary notes - they are hard to maintain so maybe doing this verbally or putting your personal summaries in a doc on github so you don't have to clean up? 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Ethics submission (the commitee meet generally 2 x month - or at least they're supposed to) so I've just missed themost recent one and will shoot for the July meeting. 
* Meetings with the consortia.
* Events website. 
* OLS Application. 
* External communication about the PPIE and ECR sessions (planned for July 6th).
* Summary notes (back in the habit). 

#### Where do you need help?

* Would love if I could offload the Code of Conduct and GitHub documentation tasks (possibly to EZ). 
	* EK - let's try to have a discussion with EZ about tasks.  

#### Any other topics

* Any suggestions for how I can better support EZ?


## Date: 14 June 2022

## Check-in ritual

### Project specific Reflection

* LC is away for the next few weeks and the NIHR report deadline is coming up so I'm stepping up with DC to fill in some PPIE gaps, the Drugs Coding work is getting set up quick as the wave 1 funding is wrapping up soon so quite a few projects have deadlines to meet. 
* The new Data Wrangler is getting a lot put on their plate, and EZ has some space to wrap their head around things. 
* I haven't heard much about the stakeholder mapping task and Mural is blocked so it seems like Excel might be a good place for things at this point in time. 
* The TREx ethics forms may not have been the correct ones to fill out based on the current handover for TREx - Tony and Vanessa have been emailed to get more clarity on this. 
* DC is starting to set up conections with the consortia PMs so I can reach out about PPIE workstreams. 
	* EK - let's bring the Mural issue to the Whitaker lab meeting this week as it seems to be becoming more of a problem.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Probation statements
	* EK - we have discussed this and SB to submit this week. 
* Workload (taking things in moderation)
	* EK - you already have a lot of tasks so please concentrate on those ones and don't take anymore unless it is urgent.

* Feeling like I need to dial back the workload a touch this week and focus on only a few big tasks. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Figuring out what ethics forms actually need to be submitted (and to who - the link on Topdesk returns a `Page not Found`)
* Supporting GitHub training materials being collated 
* Supporting DC with the NIHR report (PPIE lead is away on leave) 
* External AIM-RSF website

#### Where do you need help?

### Project specific Reflection

Feeling a bit stuck in places due to not having a clear picture of what’s going on inside the consortia. 
We need to get an information processing piece in place, and after that’s confirmed then I might be able to start reaching out to folk and having coffee chats to get an idea of what’s going on. 
So I’m feeling a bit stuck unable to identify the known unknowns, and daunted but unknown unknowns.
* EK - get yourself invited to project meetings so that you can be that lurker - listen for people of interest and also tasks you can intervene. 

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Approaching AutSPACEs workblocks
	* EK - planning of what task need doing, time they will take and deadlines for doing each - work out with GA. Also think about blocking some time to do this work.

## Date: 31 May 2022 

### Check-in ritual
* EB was absoultely fab with nuggets of knowledge this past week! 
* I'm super happy with how the GitHub meeting went and I think it brought a lot of clarity to the path ahead.
	* EK - this is great!   

### Project specific Reflection
* GitHub meeting was super useful & we've now got some clear actions and a path ahead
* I got a lot of clarity from small meetings last week about the Stakeholder mapping -  it was a rare "this meeting could not have been an email" type of thing and it was so great to get the clarity. 
* I would like to move forward with DC/EK/MS clearly identifying time requirements. 
	* EK - I will follow up with DC about the minimum objectives. 


### Notes to discuss during 1:1
* Are there any comms channels between myself & the next layer (DC/EK/MS) that I'm not utilizing/that would be useful? 
	* EK - I will feedback to MS but do contact her about any specific help you need.

* ✅ Drafted stakeholder mapping and synced across the various folks about project scope. 

	* EK - Great work! 💪

#### What did you struggle with?
* The specific style and frequency of co-working that was scheduled for the presentation ate into a lot of the time during the week and delayed other tasks. 
	* EK - this is fine - you will have time when you need to priortise talks etc, - this is part of your role so just keep other tasks ticking over at those times. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

	* EK - don't stress about this - you are doing great! 🌟 

#### Any other topics
* EK - I will email HR about probation statements as theses are currently not on your Cezanne. 


## Date: 24 May 2022

### Check-in ritual
Have been feeling very appreciated by the team lately. Good vibes all around.
* EK - I am getting great feedback on how you are doing so a big well done!

### Project specific Reflection

Got a lot of clarity around work remit, project scope, and work tasks in the past week which is great! The citizen science platform is a big part of work that is a priority for the project. It will require focus groups first and appropriate scoping, but it is a big piece that we’re moving forward with. There’s a lot of work coming down the pipeline now and I have a better understanding of how to prioritise tasks aligned with the bigger picture. 
* EK - this is great for getting clarity on tasks.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Run through updates, larger discussion on the ["help" task](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building/edit/main/project-management/1-1-meetings/Sophia-Batchelor/weekly-meetings.md#where-do-you-need-help)
	* Am unsure how to balance "I can support or take on a task" with the worry that I'm taking work off people. I feel like I can keep myself busy but also have tasks flagged as key that I don't know how to/if I should take over. 
	* EK - I have met with DC and MS about producing a minimum set of task for you and then some 'what would be nice' add ons. DC should get this to us this week.

#### Any other topics



## Date: 17 May 2022

### Check-in ritual

DC (and EB with all the set up!!) has been an absolute star. I've been seeing the amount of invisible work that he does and it's brill ⚡

### Project specific Reflection

* Have found (almost) all the docs! It was a massive unblocking to get access to things and read through them to understand the project and how I'm meant to fit in. 
* Am still finding my feet understanding what my role is within the bigger picture - but I know this will become clear with time (and once I've met with LC) 
	* EK - Good progress getting access to all docs. 🌟

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* DC with some great support, giving feedback, and working hard to get me up to speed. 

* EK - keep asking for help where you need it. Wonderful that you have DC and EG for support. 

#### What did you achieve?
> these are easy wins as they're 'learning' and 'get to know folk' focused. 

**Big Win:** 🌟 I made a flyer (that I was quite proud of) and drafted up information about the ECR lunch session to be sent out. 
* EK - the flyer looks fab. 

Community Management:
* ✅ Have got access to the GitHub Repo and Sharepoint and am familair with the contents
* ✅ found an area of the NIHR AIM site which has docs on PPIE here
* ✅ Gained better understanding of the challenges some groups are facing in terms of data access and sharing of methods.

* ✅ Attended first RSF Ops meeting (and made a few suggestions)
* ✅ Reached out to events team to understand what their role is and how my role and theirs can work together 
* ✅ Read through Sharepoint files and got up to speed some more

PPIE/Focus Groups:
* ✅ Read through the TREx forms and have started scoping what sort of questions the focus groups are needed for. 
* ✅ Had meeting wih Georgia to learn about how AutSPACEs approached focus groups. 

General Learning:

* Feeling guilty for not doing more work for the SSI speed blogging group. 

#### What would you like to work on this week?

Urgent & Important: 
1. Prepping for and running the ECR lunchtime session (3hrs)
2. Preparing materials for the brainstorm meeting on migrating docs to GitHub (5 hours, open ended)

Urgent: 
3. AutSPACEs conference talk (8-10 hours - of this week). Deadline May 30th to have it filmed and submitted. 

Important:
4. Draft of TREx Ethics Submission (3 work days)
	
* EK - Looking great - but let's talk more about task prioritising next week.  

#### Where do you need help?

* Understanding more about how different groups use GitHub (emphasis on understanding the logic, the approach, and the organizational structure)
	* EK - I gave a tour of the Decovid repository and we talked about how it is used and approach taken in that project. 

#### Any other topics

* Are there any books, blogs, or short coffee readings about community management, health data etc that you would reccomend. 
	* EK - I will have a think about this more but of the top of my head - I like [CSCCE blogs and resources](https://www.cscce.org/resources/online-communities-and-communication-tools/)


## Date: 10 May 2022

### Check-in ritual
* AB was a massive help double checking some admin & reimbursement forms I was unsure about AND had a great coffee last week getting me up to speed
* EG was super awesome getting me up to speed with the RSF
* Awesome onboarding session with MS, DC, & EB
* Super grateful for folks from the Public Policy team who took me to lunch on Friday
	* EK - great that you have connected with so many people already. 🌟

### Project specific Reflection

* Current tasks are about getting up to speed with where things are at with the RSF, and what sort of work do I need to muck in on short term. 
  * There seems to be a good opportunity to lead with some Turing Way workflows in how notes and the like are stored & shared. Will need to have a few scoping conversations to figure out what the best way forward will be. 
  	* EK - let's chat about DECOVID repo when you start working no your repository. 	
	* This presents a small challenge as putting a line in the sand and forcing everything into markdown and github may not meet the community where they are and so deep thinking is needed. 
* Worked to integrate reviewer feedback for a conference submission on AutSPACEs with GA. Am exploring/figuring out what the split between AutSPACEs and AIM will be.
	* EK - This is great!  

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* Feeling like I'm not necessarily doing "tasks" at the moment. Am just unsure of if I should be working harder and mucking in more: and am finding the balance difficult between the phd mindset vs working life mindset where it's okay to not solve all the world's problems in a day. 
	* EK - start a few of the tasks from your list sent last friday such as community mapping and glossary - drawing info together that you have and then asking for input.   

#### Who did you help this week?

* GA with integrating reviewer feedback
* DC & EB with brainstorming some operational steps for AIM that support an open workflow
	* EK - great work! 

#### Who helped you this week?

* Everyone!
	* Onboarding: MS (with the awesome checklist), EK, EB & DC, EG, AB
	* Feeling welcome: everyone as listed above and also JD, AC, VH, + Turing office folk 

#### What did you achieve?

* Connected with RSF collaborators CN and MF via email 
* Set up coffee call with CN (collaborator) (DC suggested we get in touch) 
* Worked on a revision request for a conference workshop for AutSPACEs
* Connected with DC around RSF strategy and working openly
* Finished reading through RSF github repo
* Finished HR onboarding & Cyber Security training
* Started working on reimbursement forms 
* Onboarded into cm-team with MS
* Met with 4 of Turing's leads on the AIM RSF and synthesized an overview of the project & my role
	* ⚠️ would appreciate guidance on where the from the email notes can be stored
* Collated preliminary scope of my responsibilities 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Covid delays have made it difficult to meet with specific PPIE folk
	* EK - Just keep asking when you can connect.  
* General feelings of "should I be doing something more useful with my time" 
	* EK - you have already done so much! Keep going to meetings, listening and meeting more people - this is the unseen work of community managers. 
* Also need to keep an eye on how I'm structuring my days as I'm starting early and finishing late and have been excited and caught up in tasks so haven't taken clever breaks. It was the first week though, so it's a self-check more than anything else. 
	* EK - Something to keep an eye on - you will find a good routine once you are fully settled in. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- [ ] Continue reading through the resources shared by Dave and Elizabeth, & what is on the GitHub repo. 
- [ ] Organise a meeting with LC and other PPIE folk to understand the PPIE work that is being done.
- [ ] Attend all AIM RSF meetings and get a deeper understanding of how my work fits in 
- [ ] Bubble away at ethics approval, glossary, community mapping and open workflow. 

#### Where do you need help?

* Brainstorming where to start on 'creating an open workflow that embodies TPS principles into AIM RSF'. Don't need an instant solution, more so an experienced sounding board to help formalize ideas and think up the right questions to ask. 

#### Any other topics

* You've mentioned that you maintain a repo that is mainly used by you (and not collaborators). Can I ask why others don't use it? (I'm trying to scope out how open consortia folks will be to github workflows).
