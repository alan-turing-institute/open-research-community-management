### Check-in ritual

A good but busy week! Feel like some of the pieces of the partnership are starting to come together more and was nice to find a link into the Turing Way via the Code Review group, especially after discussions at last week's lab meeting.
- MS: Super delighted to see this coming together.

### Project specific Reflection

Funding call and senior research associate advert closing is a reminder that we the community of the partnership will be growing very soon. Reflecting on what I need to prepare to ensue onboarding is as soon as necessary. Also expert panel meeting went well, am keen to captialise and plan for the next meetings.
- MS: Impact, purpose and connections between expert panels will be helpful in designing your sesssions.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Who did you help this week?

* Helped AM with interviewing 3 candidates for RPM role
* Reviewed peer review chapter in TTW for LK
* Helped answer application queries for SM funding call

    - FAQs that you are responding to will be helpful
    - Application template could be provided 

#### Who helped you this week?

* EK helped me and AR- showed us Github repo and helped show examples of documentation I could utilise
* MOG helped with partnership planning
  - MS: Really helpful that she is thinking and nudging about this.

* Almost finished Github public v private and comms strategy document 
  - MS: Looking forward to reading them. We can try to set a miro board for this. 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Found it difficult to put together documentation from scratch- definitely find it easier to work collaboratively with someone on this.
  - MS: Same! Maybe ask in the cm team channel for help? But glad that it is.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finalise comms and github document
* Make a start on stakeholder mapping
* Chase up RM on GE piece
  - MS: Excited to work on this with you.

## Date: 18 January 2022

### Check-in ritual
Feeling good to be on the same page as MOG and HM this week- definite push for us to start putting together roadmap type docs with the scientific leads of the partnership so we can plan for the year. 
- That would be really helpful in getting some timeline added to leads' calendar. All the best!

### Project specific Reflection

Started off feeling on top of things this week and now slightly less! Putting together the expert panel agenda has made it clear that we're not quite aligned as a group with what we want out of the panel so need to work through this.
- Have experts been consulted for their interest in what they want to bring to the panel? 

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Who did you help this week?

Helped the research leads with a letter to the editor they want to submit for a potential journal submission, helped HM with some funding call queries.
- 🙌

#### Who helped you this week?

* AR helped me with what I needed to do for goatherding. 
 * You did a pretty solid goadtherding. I need to keep up with that next week :D 
* HM helped me think about what other documents I need to put together for the partnership such as a comms plan.
 * Comm strategy doc will definitely be useful especially to align what is announced by you and what needs to be aligned with the Turing comms team. I would love to see how this develops and if I can help with that. I suggest adding some internal engagement aspect in there too.

#### What did you achieve?

* Have put together a presentation on slack for community management for this week's lab meeting
 * Amazing! Do upload them on Zenodo if you feel that could be generally useful. You can cite that in a chapter that you are planning to write for the TTW. 
* Have started the expert panel agenda- needs sending out asap 
* Team charter should be finalised-ish by Friday
 * This is amazing! Looking forward to reading that. 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Expert panel agenda- need consensus by the end of the week!]
 *  Keeping my fingers crossed. Looks like this is a lot of back and forth planning.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Expert panel meeting is on Monday. Once thats out the way, hoping to have time to start other documents- potentially a comms plan, stakeholder mapping.
* Also need to think about how to keep workshop community engaged, have dropped off a bit
 * Happy to cowork on some of these with you and see where we can align you work with TPS.

#### Where do you need help?

* Have a meeting with EK next week on community Githubs and will also pick her brain on comms stuff as suggested by HM
* Perhaps some advice on how to keep workshop community engaged- am struggling for ideas at the moment

### Check-in ritual

### Before this call

### Agenda and Notes

#### Who did you help this week?

- AH in setting meeting.
- Helping out attendees.

#### Who helped you this week?

- AR in adding illustrations in a chapter
- CH in bouncing off ideas

#### What did you achieve?

* Submitted SMART objective
* Ran the second workshop - hopin was useful for floating around the rooms, white board worked during the day.

#### What did you struggle with?

* Being unaware of what happens in each room is a bit of challenge

#### Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on. 
 Currently planning for Roche workshop 3. Have a couple of optional co-working sessions for attendees this week and early next- think seeing how attended these are will be a useful temperature of current level of engagement. Have started stakeholder/contact mapping and have a good list of what I think may need setting up e.g newsletter- but don't feel at the point that I can 'start' any of these actions just yet.

#### Since last week, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?
Have put together a 'to-do' document which has helped focus my thinking on what is needed for the partnership going forward. Also did an Open canvas. Am slightly nervous about ensuring attendees are in working groups for the workshop 3 presentations as not much response so far.

#### Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.
Nothing comes to mind for now.

#### Anything else:
Can you have a public Github but make some documents on it private? Still thinking about where to store Turing-Roche documents going forward

Would like to know how much you involved comms/events in stuff like the Book Dash?
