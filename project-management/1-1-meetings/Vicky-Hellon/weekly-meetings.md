### Check-in ritual
Feeling good to be on the same page as MOG and HM this week- definite push for us to start putting together roadmap type docs with the scientific leads of the partnership so we can plan for the year. 

### Project specific Reflection

Started off feeling on top of things this week and now slightly less! Putting together the expert panel agenda has made it clear that we're not quite aligned as a group with what we want out of the panel so need to work through this.

* Have started the expert panel agenda- needs sending out asap

#### What did you struggle with?

* Expert panel agenda- need consensus by the end of the week!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

### Before this call

### Agenda and Notes

#### Who did you help this week?

- AH in setting meeting.
- Helping out attendees.

- AR in adding illustrations in a chapter
- CH in bouncing off ideas

#### What did you achieve?

* Submitted SMART objective

#### What did you struggle with?

* Being unaware of what happens in each room is a bit of challenge

#### Review your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on. 
 Currently planning for Roche workshop 3. Have a couple of optional co-working sessions for attendees this week and early next- think seeing how attended these are will be a useful temperature of current level of engagement. Have started stakeholder/contact mapping and have a good list of what I think may need setting up e.g newsletter- but don't feel at the point that I can 'start' any of these actions just yet.

#### Since last week, review progress you’ve made towards your goals. Any challenges to mention?
Have put together a 'to-do' document which has helped focus my thinking on what is needed for the partnership going forward. Also did an Open canvas. Am slightly nervous about ensuring attendees are in working groups for the workshop 3 presentations as not much response so far.

#### Review if we can attract any attention or help highlight your work.
Nothing comes to mind for now.

#### Anything else:
Can you have a public Github but make some documents on it private? Still thinking about where to store Turing-Roche documents going forward

Would like to know how much you involved comms/events in stuff like the Book Dash?
