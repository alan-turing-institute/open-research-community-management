## Date: 20 September 2022

**Check-in ritual**
PPIE month (turned PPIE week) was excellent :tada:
    * EK - sounds like all events were a success so great work!

### Project specific Reflections
Lessons learned:

- Don't plan all events on the same week!
- Preparing topics for people to discuss always helps.
- Having multiple hosts/co-hosts is really helpful.
- Using GitHub discussions is good for people with no experience on GH.
- Having someone on hand to give instructions on using GitHub would be great.

* EK - I will check in with IT about the internet.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- How events went

#### Who did you help this week?
SB with PPIE month/week

#### Who helped you this week?
- SB was amazing with PPIE month/week and helping out with Collab Cafe
- RS and MM were great to have there in the Collab Cafe too

#### What did you achieve?
- I'm very happy about how Collab Cafe went
- I worked on Connections workshop stuff
* EK - You also supported the other events. 

#### What did you struggle with?
- Time and the Turing internet :joy:

#### What would you like to work on next week?
- Meetings to plan various events/collab things in AIM (Slack, GitHub for Project Management, Sharing code)
    - https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpw/trew.html
- **Schedule training (priority!)**
- Analyse survey data
- Contact people to book them for ECR Lunchtime sessions

#### Where do you need help?

#### Any other topics


## Date: 14 September 2022

**Check-in ritual**
I'm very excited that RS has joined the RSF team :sparkles:

### Project specific Reflection
A lot of things are happening this month! That's exciting, but I also feel like I'm losing my grip on things a little. That's not great, as I'm not able to focus on the things I need to. This is exacerbated this week as I came back to a bit of a backlog after RSECon. Hopefully I'll be able to clear some things this week and be back to a more normal state next week 🤞

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- I submitted my probation review; does that look alright?
- I'm a little freaked out by the Collaboration Cafe session on Thursday. I'm somehow worried both that people will not show up and that they will but won't find it useful 🙈

#### Who did you help this week?

#### Who helped you this week?
- SB has been great with handling communications for the RSF (the website, the promotion packs etc.)
- REG team members were really welcoming and friendly last week at RSECon 🥰

#### What did you achieve?
- Last week not so much
    - I was at RSECon for most of the time, which was a lot of fun! I learned about Quatro which I've been meaning to look into for a while. I also learned about software licensing and publication and a tool that should help with publication eventually but is not yet ready. I also helped host a panel session on a project I've been working on for a while called Coding Confessions. I also finally met most of the people I worked on this with, except for Patricia!
    - I'm way too excited about this but I was able to put some people from the consortia in touch with each other when one needed the other's help
    - I submitted my probation review and worked on some other admin things
    - Meetings/working on Connections workshop
    - I also had to spend some time on Carpentries things
- The survey is live and with a lot of emails we have 20 responses - I don't think I'm getting more at this point. I'm very excited that one person shared their email for the purpose of them being contacted to teach in the RSF :tada:
- I started a report on skills gaps and training needs
- I chaired the first ECR Lunchtime session for the academic year on 1 September. 

#### What did you struggle with?
- I've been feeling really drained the last week and it's been difficult to focus on tasks. That's been impacting my ability to prioritise; even though I know what needs to be done, I get distracted by things that need to be done eventually (forgetting I can't do everything this week).

#### What would you like to work on next week?
- Prep for and run the Collaborations Cafe
    - make intro slides or general spiel about the Collab Cafes
    - create a space on GitHub for people to add training resources
    - create a HackMD, ideally with activities for people
    - update calendar invite to share HackMD and act as a reminder it's happening
- I'm attending a workshop on interpersonal skills (receiving feedback)
- The skills gaps and training needs document

#### Where do you need help?
- Not sure; I know what I need to do and I know how to do it, but I'm finding it difficult to find the focus/mental space
    * EK - You are doing great so keep going. :smile:  
- One thing I'm not so sure how to do is changing a GitHub repository; it's currently a repo for the GitHub workshop but it should be a repo for training in general with a folder for the GitHub repo. But the repo is synced with Zenodo and I don't know what happens if I stop the integration and rename the repository.

#### Any other topics
- Can you approve [this PR](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pull/2636) to add my name to the TTW project members?
* EK - this is done!

* EK - let's book a chat about Elixir and the training they do that can fit with RSF. 

## 30 August 2022

**Check-in ritual**
- Shout out to HS who agreed to help out with a lunchtime session ✨
  - EK - this is great idea to use TTW as an example of how to use github.

### Project specific Reflection
I've made some progress with training and event planning, but some things are still a little stuck.
Hopefully the meetings with other RSF members today will be helpful.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- Training plan
  - EK - Github basics and R training sounds like a good plan for this autumn.
  - Also making a list of resources available is a good idea.

#### Who did you help this week?
- I helped SB and GA with editing some text for AutSPACES ethics

#### Who helped you this week?
- HS agreed to help out with a lunchtime session ✨

#### What did you achieve?
- I incorporated feedback to the survey from community managers and RSF members
- I sent out the survey to all AIM researchers and project managers
- I sent out invites to ECR Lunchtime sessions and Collab Cafes until the end of 2022
- I planned the next ECR Lunchtime session
- I have a tentative plan for training in Autumn
- I started working on my probation review

#### What did you struggle with?
- I had to email a bunch of people and I found it difficult figuring out what events and information to share with whom
  - EK - making your work more transparent will help to share all your work - website, slack, github repo.  

#### What would you like to work on next week?
- Attend RSF meetings
- ECR Lunchtime session (reminders, prep, chairing)
- Start skills gaps and training document
- Submit the probation review
- Other meetings

#### Where do you need help?
- This week: feedback on the probation review

#### Any other topics


## Date: 16 August 2022

**Check-in ritual**

### Project specific Reflection
Things were kind of slow the last couple of weeks, partly because of personal things and partly because people were away.
There has been some progress though: I've met with all project managers now, given the first GitHub follow-up session, have a version of the skills/training survey I'm reasonably happy with, and started organsing things a bit more on GitHub.
SB and I also started having weekly sync ups which I think will be very useful.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- I'd love some feedback on the survey to assess skill gaps and training needs.
- Supervision style.

#### Who did you help this week?
I helped out SB during our sync up last Friday.

#### Who helped you this week?
- SB explained how to work with GitHub to manage projects, which was excellent :sparkles:
- AD gave some excellent feedback on the survey I've been working with 💖

#### What did you achieve?
- I've now met with all AIM project managers
- I've made a list of the asks from the consortia members (project managers, ECRs, PIs) I've spoken with
- I've set up a meeting with PIs from one of the consortia
- I've given the first follow-up GitHub session
- I have a version of the survey I'm happy with
- SB and I have been working on a shared project board with tasks for the AIM RSF organisation
- I've started working on onboarding docs and an event preparation checklist
- Attended the CM training
- Helped out with and attended CarpentryCon sessions

#### What did you struggle with?
- I've been going through some personal stuff that't affected my concentration.
- Some blockers in RSF planning
 - internal comms - slack
 - website - EK will contact comms about this. 
 - Info RoPa

#### What would you like to work on next week?
- Pilot the survey on CMs and adjust based on feedback
- Give the next follow-up GitHub session
- Send invites for the next regular ECR sessions
- Present at the Whitaker lab meeting

#### Where do you need help?
- I'd love some feedback on the survey
- Some of the blockers we've been stuck on

EK - onboarding documents on Github repo - how is that going? 

EK - survey feedback
* Q2 - change other academic staff to academic infrastructure roles, just clinical staff is ok I think - they could put something in other if they want. or clinical - doctor versus clinical research staff?
* Q3 - I suspect that most of them will not understand what we mean by open and repro so they will probably be satisfied - what do you want to get out of this question? is it really needed?
* Q4 - is good ! Make fair principles as a separate option to open data and code. I think I would have FAIR, open data and code, reproducible research, research data/software management, open access publishing. 
* Section 3 - do you think you need to define the topics more - short definitions so thats people are super clear what each is about?
* Q12 - do you want to add Git?
* Section 4 topics need to be defined as well - maybe also add working in secure environments - I'm thinking of the accredited researcher training that is needed for data safe havens. I think we need to start offering that - we could get this maybe free through ONS. 
* What do you think healthcare in the UK is? - about structure of NHS primary and secondary care or more about health data research environment in UK? seems very wide topic.
* could also add healthcare legal framework here - gdpr, NHS NDOO etc, [caldicott guardian/prinicples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldicott_Report#Caldicott_principles) and this https://www.england.nhs.uk/ig/ig-resources/
* this platform can be used for training for nhs data security - https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/data-security-awareness/
* Section 5 - writing collab documents add google docs here too, science communication - very wide - what do you mean? writing for wider audiences? using communication tools?

**Check-in ritual**
I had a lovely conversation with the project manager of one of the consortia about ways of sharing code while keeping the data private.

### Project specific Reflection
Last week has been dominated by the GitHub session and meetings with consortia members.
All in all, both have been pretty good and I'm trying to fix the things that are less good ✨

I did notice, however, that I've not been making as much progress as I'd wanted to on some of the objectives I'd set for myself in my probation document (e.g. skill gaps, strategy to relaunch the ECR sessions).
  * EK - keep these tasks in mind and keep plugging away at them.  

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- I've heard from my meetings with consortia members about relevant communities and I'm not sure how much it makes sense to try to connect with them.
- Approach to meeting project managers.
- Approach to collecting information from ECRs.

**Check-in ritual**
- I'm very happy we got more people to show up for the ECR session on Wednesday and I'm hoping we can make a useR group happen 🏴‍☠️✨
- EB is back 💞

### Project specific Reflection

- Things have been going pretty well! I'm making some progress on arranging meetings with researchers and I'm also getting somewhere with the GitHub slides.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

- I've been working a bit slower than I'd like - part heat, part politics, part meetings - so I think I won't come to the office/HDR-UK event on Wednesday.

#### Who did you help this week?

- I think SB is quite happy she doesn't have to do the GitHub training :)

#### Any other topics

- I'm pretty nervous about meeting up with one of the PIs today 🙈

 * EK - R course for data science - well done for getting touch with REG team to develop this new course. 
 * EK to talk to Malvika about putting training videos on Turing way channel.

## Date: 5 July 2022

**Check-in ritual**

Had a lovely chat with JD about (broadly) language ✨

### Project specific Reflection
Last week got pretty busy; I was able to do a few things, but not everything I wanted. I kind of forgot I took Friday off 😅

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- The OLS application
 - EK - great job drafting this. 

#### Who did you help this week?

I helped out MM a bit with GitHub collaboration workflows

#### Who helped you this week?
- MM with introductions to AIM members
- SB with flyers for the ECR lunch session

#### What did you achieve?
- I figured out a level to pitch the GitHub workshop at/what content to cover :tada:
- I had some really nice/productive meetings.

- I finished all the Bob's Business courses.
- I was introduced (via email) to some of the project managers/COIs of the consortia and I tried to plan meetings with them.
- I worked a little on advertising the next couple of ECR lunchtime sessions.
  - EK - all great - well done.

#### What did you struggle with?
- I've started reaching out to project managers/PIs in the AIM consortia, but I'm not necessarily hearing back from them. 
  - EK - try to find some work arounds to meet those postdocs/research assistants as they can be the most useful contacts for you. 
- I still struggle with managing my time/to-do list.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Finish the first draft of the GitHub workshop (from last week)
- Submit the OLS application (due on the 7th)
- Follow up on various training things (Turing data science training, CM training resources)
- Do some reading on things I can contribute to (TTW, Carpentries lesson on managing computatational projects)
- Try to consolidate some of what I've learned

#### Where do you need help?

I think I'm okay? I'm still struggling with some things (obviously) but I think I have some ideas on how to approach the issues.

#### Any other topics

## Date: 28 June 2022

**Check-in ritual**
I'm just really excited to be thinking about more specific things (training, events) for the AIM RSF community ✨

### Project specific Reflection

* I've been working on brainstorming workshops we can offer for ECRs easily.
* I started writing abstracts for those workshops.
* I've been working on drafting the OLS-6 application.
* I still had to submit documents for background checks etc.
* I'm continuing to meet up with people (AL, GA, CF) and finding out areas of overlap in our projects.
* I finally got access to Bob's business videos! So I'm going through the courses on there.
* I went throught the Turing Way "Ways of working" document.
* I worked on my probation documents.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

* It'd be nice to talk about the "Ways of working" a bit, just to clarify some of the expectations.
  * EK - processes that you do in your team. These can be kept within private repos but need to be shared with those working in your team or wider if necessary. 
    * An example would be an issue template for use when planning events and an accompanying document to set out the process clearly.  
* Any feedback on my probation document?
  * EK - Objectives 1 to 4 look good - make the bullet points points specific task to achieve the objective. Probably take out objective 5.

#### Who did you help this week?

* I made a plot of the consortia wishes for support that DC used in the interim for the funder.
  * EK - great job :star:

#### Who helped you this week?

* The community managers groups gave me some ✨excellent:sparkles: tips about approaching the mapping of training needs of ECRs.
* SB has been a rockstar (as usual) with answering GitHub questions.

#### What did you achieve?

* I've been doing some planning/writing about potential workshops and activities to support community building in my first few months (workshop brainstorming/abstract writing/OLS application/probation document).
* I'm still working on various "first days" employment things (background checks, training on policies).
* I met up with a few people working on very relevant projects!

#### What did you struggle with?

* Figuring out what's useful enough to put on GitHub.
* Finding time to clean up notes enought that they're shareable 😅

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finish the OLS application.
* Finish a first draft of the GitHub presentation.
  * EK - what is the purpose of the training? write some learning outcomes. Blooms taxonomy. 
* Finish the policy training videos/courses.
* Write two more abstracts for ECR workshops.
  * EK - Please do try to collate the skills of the Comm management team in an issue as that would be helpful for all of us - what course could each of us teach easily? and have materials for already?
* Meet more people!

#### Where do you need help?

* I'll probably ask for some feedback on the OLS application once I've finished the first draft if that's okay!
* EK - please do send my way if helpful. 

#### Any other topics

- I need to do some work this week on Carpentries things (testing out the new infrastructure for lessons, going through and closing open issues).
  * EK - I think we need to find out where we can store our training materials for easy access - github, carpentries style, turing moodle?

## Date: 21 June 2022

**Check-in ritual**
- It was lovely to have intro coffees with VH, ZE, SG, and AR
- The "Sex, gender, binaries, and categories" talk on Friday was really cool 😻

### Project specific Reflection
- I've made some progress with reading documentation for the AIM RSF.
- I've been working on synthesising the things I've been reading.
- I've scheduled or had meetings with most CMs and I'm trying to meet the most relevant Turing RSF people too.
- Getting better at doing things on GitHub 😊
- Some things need to be changed/redone in terms of organising events.
- I've been feeling a little overwhelmed - I'm making progress with understanding how things work but new things keep popping up!
  - EK - these are all great things and keep going with all of this introductory meetings and readings. It is going to feel a lot at the moment but will get better. 

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- I haven't been able to get into contributing to the Turing Way yet - it'd be nice to get some tips on getting involved?
  - EK - Don't worry too much about doing anything specific at the moment - just try to come along to the turing way co-working on mondays and collaboration cafes if possible. The CM team often just go there to co-work on any work they are doing to get some company and chat to each other. This will probably then surface something you might want to get involved with.   
- Any tips on managing stress/feelings of being overwhelmed would be very welcome 😊

#### Who did you help this week?
- Contributed to the Consulation on UNESCO Best Practices for Open Research
- Helped to take notes at the drug coding meeting

#### Who helped you this week?
- VH was great when I was at the office on Wednesday ✨
- SB has been amazing with AIM RSF things

#### What did you achieve?
- I've made some progress with reading documentation for the AIM RSF.
- I've been working on synthesising the things I've been reading.
- I've scheduled or had meetings with most CMs and I'm trying to meet the most relevant Turing RSF people too.
- Getting better at doing things on GitHub 😊

#### What did you struggle with?

- I've been feeling a little overwhelmed - I'm making progress with understanding how things work but new things keep popping up!
  - EK - this will hopefully get better once you understand better what your role is and what the tasks are that you need to do. You are still earning a lot so it is normal to feel this way at this point. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- SB and I are applying for OLS 6 - I need to work on the application
- Continue meeting up with RSF & other Turing people
- Dig into the AIM RSF GitHub repos and see if there's anywhere I can contribute
- Review and add content to the RSF website SB has been working on (+ form for them to register for events)
- Go through the Turing Way ways of working - EK - I can do this with you if needed. 

#### Where do you need help?
- I'm feeling fairly overwhelmed (and a bit intimidated) - any tips for handling that would be super welcome 🙏

#### Any other topics
- Malvika mentioned the Communications people will get in touch with me? They haven't yet, should I do that?
- I have 1-to-1 meetings with EG as well - should I be focusing my reflections with EG and you on different topics?
