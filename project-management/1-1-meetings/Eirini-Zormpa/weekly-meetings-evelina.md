## Date: 2 November 2022

### Check-in ritual
Massive respect to all the attendees in yesterday's R workshop who, somehow, did not make typos???? 🤯

### Project specific Reflection
Last week was pretty busy: I did a lot of work 1) restructuring repos to share more information with AIM members and doing so in a GDPR-compliant way and 2) getting ready for the R workshops, which at least for yesterday seems to have paid out ✨

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- It'd be nice to clarify my line management after January

#### Who did you help this week?
- I'm doing some of the GDPR research that'll be helpful for the RSF and CMs in general
- I've been making sure not to overload SB who's still recovering

#### Who helped you this week?
- EM was a great helper yesteday.

#### What did you achieve?

* Replace this text with a bullet point list of what you achieved this week.
* It's ok if your list is only one bullet point long!

#### What did you struggle with?
- I'm doing okay at the moment, though I'm a bit rushed.
- The survey analysis has fallen through the cracks

#### What would you like to work on next week?
- ECR lunchtime session
- Share resources from yesterday's session with attendees
- Office hours for R
- Prep for next workshop
- Do some documentattion on running events
- Slack prep

#### Where do you need help?
- There's a lot of things I'm planning on doing and I know how to do at least most of them, but I don't think I have time to. Some help with prioritising things would be helpful.

#### Any other topics


## Date: 19 October 2022

### Project specific Reflection

- Things have been alright - I've been working on the GitHub workshop for yesterday afternoon mostly. It honestly didn't go as well as I would have liked, but at least we can learn from the things that went wrong.
- Being in the office on Thursday and Friday last week stole a lot of the focus time I had reserved 😢
- I started having weekly meetings with SB and DC on Monday which is nice!

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

- Lessons learned from yesterday's GitHub workshop: we mostly had issues with write access in the repos: the general AIM consortia team didn't give write access to any of the repo + external folk that we couldn't add as members in the organisation had to work with forks.
- People are being interviewed for RSF positions :tada:

#### Who did you help this week?

Uhm not sure, my memory is terrible 🙈

#### Who helped you this week?

- CO has been fantastic with finding people to step in for the Collab Cafe this Thursday
- RS was a huge help in the workshop yesterday

#### What did you achieve?

- Did lots of prep work on the GitHub workshop
- Delivered the GitHub workshop. Despite the difficulties we did get people to make a commit and submit pull requests! We have 6 merged already, 3 approved and 1 that still needs to be edited. So all in all just over half of the attendees? I'll email the slides to everyone and remind them they can come get help at the Collab Cafe tomorrow.
- Linked up with the MRC (!) Statistics CoP on MLTC who in turn introduced me to the NIHR Statistics CoP 🤷‍♀️

#### What did you struggle with?

- I have not made any progress on the survey. I was in the office at the time I was planning on working on it and it's not great for focused work.
- Permissions on GitHub were a pain at the workshop yesterday but at least now we know and can improve the delivery for next time

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Survey (3rd time lucky? 🤞)
- Collab Cafe
- Do some documentation writing on running events

#### Where do you need help?

- I keep waiting to fix the survey a bit more before I share it, but I guess I might just give up and share it right after I commit this.

#### Any other topics

- I've joined a Code Club to get a bit better on my R skills (it's about writing functions, creating packages etc)

## Date: 12 October 2022

### Check-in ritual
I asked three people from the AIM consortia to help out with the R sessions and they all said yes 🥰

### Project specific Reflection
Last week was pretty full on with non-RSF things: the King's talk, TTW Collab Cafe, OLS, a panel I'm doing for the SSI. Since Monday I've been focusing on RSF things, which has been lovely.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

- CO can't make it to the Collab Cafe next week after all - the plan was to discuss data ethics applications and a couple of the project managers said they'd be there to discuss that. Any tips on how to approach that?

#### Who did you help this week?

- SP from the Skills team with a course they've been working on
- DC with chairing yesterday's open seminar

#### Who helped you this week?

#### What did you achieve?

- Gave the talk at King's with ALS
- Had the ECR Lunchtime talk - not a huge number of attendees but it was nice!
- I sent off a *video* recording of myself after only 5 tries. I mean, I still hate it but :joy:
- I've managed to make some progress on the survey analysis this week
- I advertised the R workshops yesterday and got 12 sign ups

#### What did you struggle with?

* I've been trying to stick to 9:00-17:30 and pomodoro everything. I like it when it works but it doesn't come naturally.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Actually finish making the plots for the survey and start working on the text.
    * I'm sorry I forgot to share it, will do so ASAP
* Prep for the GitHub workshops
* Advertise the Collab Cafe

#### Where do you need help?

I think I'm alright for now!

#### Any other topics


## Date: 5 October 2022

### Check-in ritual
I had some really nice responses from people about working on data ethics applications in the Collab Cafe :sparkles:

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- I'm hoping to use the survey as a way to start a more general conversation either about training or about reproducible documents (it's in R Markdown) - any tips on how to get that started?
- I've been struggling to find time to reach out to consortia and I end up leading/presenting at more events than I would like. Any ideas about people/topics for ECR events or people to help out with R training would be super helpful!

#### Who did you help this week?
- I'm presenting with ALS about TTW at King's

- The topics I mentioned above
- I'll ask for some feedback on the survey analysis/write-up once I'm done
- Prioritising continues to be difficult 😅

#### Any other topics
Not really!

## Date: 29 July 2022

### Check-in ritual
I had a lovely conversation with one of the project managers about sharing code while preserving data privacy.

### Project specific Reflection
This week has not been as productive as I would have liked, but overall I'm making some progress on building connections with the consortia, putting in place a strategy to survey skills gaps and training needs, and developing a ideas about how training could be delivered.
I'm also doing some work on documenting the processes at the RSF.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Who did you help this week?

- Uhm. Attempted to help Evelina with the ECR talk but it was cancelled 😅

#### Who helped you this week?

- Literally everyone 💛
  - Sophia especially with onboarding and all the amazingly detailed documentation
  - Also of course Evelina, Malvika, Dave, and Emma
