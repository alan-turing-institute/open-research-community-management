## 2022-08-02

### Check-in ritual

- Had about 2.5 days of writing last week, which I spent on IceNet.
- Had a slightly worrying meeting re. white papers in general.
Will update the GitHub README with some more notes about how the CTPs link to the white paper, the link between impact (past), position (present) and recommendations (future).
Going to also schedule a call with HS to clarify some questions that were raised.
- Had a good planning meeting with ZI this morning.

MS: Let's align with HS on this. We should create slide deck for what these papers are.

### Project-specific reflection

- Writing for IceNet has been going OK, if a little slowly.
Also ended up doing some reading for digital twins and made notes about it, as some of the messaging was potentially related.
- Discussed the cross-cutting-messages approach with ZI, who is putting  together a timeline for the remaining two papers.

MS: All the best!

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Whom did you help since the last meeting?

- Helped HS, JL and KR prepare for meeting with illustrator for white papers.

MS: will chat with HS about in house data vis expertise (RSE), interactive - check the need and store in an issue.

#### Who helped you since the last meeting?

- ZI, who has followed up with everyone who was to review the Scivision section.
- AD, for giving me space to present the work going into the white papers at the S&R meeting.

MS: Great stuff.

#### What did you achieve?

- Progress with draft of the IceNet case study.

#### What are you working on this week and what are your priorities?

- Same as last week:
focused on IceNet at the moment, and hope to tackle DyME-CHH later this week.
- Attending the Scivision co-working call as the PDRAs have feedback they want to give in person.

#### Where do you need help?

- Could we briefly discuss the concerns I mentioned above in the check-in?

## 2022-07-26

### Check-in ritual

- So, as I have known for a while, actually putting words on a page and sending it over for review is a wonderful experience.
The feedback I’ve received so far on the Scivision draft makes me feel much more confident about tackling the rest of the texts ahead.

MS: great job! Really exciting to see many reviews and comments from everyone.

### Project-specific reflection

- Sent over the Scivision section for review and am working on the IceNet one now.
Ideally, should be done in a day or two, before moving on to DyME-CHH.
Will provide a status update either way, at the end of the week.
- I’m still not convinced that the case-study-focused approach is the best way forward for the remaining two white papers, and think they should be anchored around cross-cutting messages and recommendations, with project-specific lessons sprinkled across the texts.
Will see what the discussion at the S&R meeting on Thursday reveals.
I have half an hour to present the project’s objectives and discuss potential angles with the PDRAs.
- For the remaining two white papers, I will approach the writing as the first/lead author (as BM said I should) and get input where required, rather than expecting collaborative writing from the start (even with prepared notes available before anyone opens the doc).

MS: These sound like a good way forward - a good risk mitigation idea.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Whom did you help since the last meeting?

- Reviewed the TPS newsletter for AB.

MS: Thank you! 🎊

#### Who helped you since the last meeting?

- ZI with lots of following up on tasks.
- BM with encouragement that the writing is on the right track re. style, message, tone etc.
- KW, who called to check how I was doing from a MH perspective.
- MS for passing on my feedback request.
- AM and ZE for reviewing the text and providing feedback/suggestions.

MS: 🌸

#### What did you achieve?

- Near-final draft of the Scivision text!!

MS: Great job!

#### What are you working on this week and what are your priorities?

- Focused on IceNet at the moment, and hope to tackle DyME-CHH later this week.
Will provide an update by the end of the week independent of whether I’ve finished or not.
- Attending the S&R meeting on Thursday (hopefully the connection works, unlike the last time I participated), where I will be discussing the third white paper with the PDRAs.

MS: Thanks for updating!

#### Where do you need help?

- I would be grateful for advice on how to kick-off the next two white papers.
Happy to discuss what worked and what didn’t in the E&S one, during our call.

MS: Let's find some time on one of the Fridays coworking.

## 2022-07-20

### Check-in ritual

- Just had a very productive all-morning planning sprint with ZI!

### Project-specific reflection

- Writing is going slowly but well.
A lot of writing is thinking, and I would’ve liked to have someone to think with to clarify ideas; just making notes doesn’t help me a lot.

- ZI really helped in our planning sprint on not just focusing on tasks but about processes.
- JL gave me feedback on the messaging for the white papers.

#### What did you achieve?

- Managed to put aside a lot of time for the white papers, even if a lot of it was spent thinking.
Really valuing having meeting-free and distraction-free time to reflect on the content.

#### What are you working on this week and what are your priorities?

- Finish Scivision and IceNet impact case studies and finalise for BM, MS and ZE to review.
- Didn’t manage last week, so will submit CM report for Q1 (22/23) before end of week.

#### Where do you need help?

- I will need reviews on the content for two of the projects featured in the white paper once it’s online.

### Check-in ritual

- Feeling super motivated after the break
- Had a long and very helpful mentorship session with YY last Friday!

### Project specific Reflection

- Unfortunately, there were no edits to the document while I was away.
Going to start engaging the post-docs directly now as we might not get much _direct_ engagement from the senior researchers.
YY and I discussed setting up co-working slots specifically for writing the white papers and sending out (optional) invites to everyone involved.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Who helped you this week?

- JD has regularly pointed me to useful reading (and potential references) for the EDT white paper
- YY has been a fount of wisdom and sage advice, and generally a fun person to catch up with every couple of weeks
- AS, for thinking of me in the context of train ticket sales this weekend

#### What did you achieve?

- Still haven’t caught up on all my e-mails, but I did go through many and also sent out the WP reminder e-mail on Friday

#### What are you working on this week and what are your priorities?

- Contacting post-docs and others recommended by core team to contribute to the E&S white paper; setting up co-working slots for this week and beyond and inviting them to it
- Start editing the document with contributors, if possible
- Meeting with ASG central about July event (Thursday); includes debrief from March event
- Have to upload ASG March event talks (been low priority, but now has been two months since the event)
- Start working on SPARRA glossy

#### Where do you need help?

- Advice on how to motivate senior researchers to contribute to the white papers
  - Q: SH mentioned recognising contributors as authors; will carrot work as well for senior people as PDRAs?

## 2022-04-11

### Check-in ritual

- Just in case it wasn’t obvious from my messages elsewhere, I’m blown away by AS’s weekly updates and want to implement something similar for my own work.
- Had a good time at CW22 and made some new connections.
Was also pleased that I managed to contribute to some core R community work on the hackday.
- Launched the drafting phase for the first ASG white paper, which felt a bit overwhelming to get out of the docks.
- Had a good chat with BC about the potential for ASG podcast episodes/mini-series; see <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/asg-community/issues/53>.
---
- MS: So glad that you could attend the CW22! Congrats for winning the hack day prize! 🎉
- MS: ASG plan looks good, so glad that BC is onboard. Agree on the observation of communicating how these by-product connect in the context of the main papers. I suggest planning a post-it note exercise with all the folks who are helping deliver different outputs.
- MS: Thank you fo sharing notes in open.

### Project specific Reflection

- Finally launched the E&S white paper.
Felt like a weight off my shoulder, as I hadn’t managed to move forward with it for some time.
- Haven’t really had any proper _community_ time lately, but that should change in May once we move to the July hybrid event.
---
- MS: Drop private email to people who are contributing tosend reminder.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Whom did you help this week?

- In the end, I wasn’t _really_ needed at the session, but I helped SG run a workshop at CW22.
  - MS: I am sure SG appreciated your support. 🌼 

#### Who helped you this week?

- KW took over my Enrichment applications as I was struggling to find time to do it before leaving for India.
  - MS: KW mentioned the enrichment application, will check if I can help.   
- AS by inspiring me with updates to the TTW community-building issue!
- (From previous week, but…) MS with giving structure to our chat about community outputs: <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/asg-community/issues/52>

#### What did you achieve?

- At the risk of sounding like a broken record, moving to the white-paper drafting phase was pretty important.

#### What did you struggle with?

- A particularly severe bout of decision paralysis.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- On leave until 27 April!
  - MS: let's rephrase this for when you return to "What are you working on this week? Let's review last week's task and prioritise them?"

## 2022-03-10

### Check-in ritual

Have been good since submitting the thesis.
Been getting lots of sleep and have been able to bring more energy to work.
The ASG event went quite well, based on the feedback from many of the participants, so I’m feeling quite motivated.

- Special thanks to HM and AY for all their behind-the-scenes help with organising the event
- MS and KW gave me lots of advice on how to run the various sessions
- Met JS and BC at 1:1 networking and discussed collaborating with them
- Social lunch was _really good_ with so many sharing their hobbies and interests

---
MS: What was challenging?
AR: Took some time to understand how much I had to be involved in shaping of the event. Lots of connections and learning experiences. HM was great support. AY helped so much behind the scene.
MS: Any plan to create a debrief document?
AR: Need to schedule a debrief event. AY has also shared a document to add details. 
MS: Connect with VH to have a chat about her F2F event planning, and also reuse a debrief document format she used for her workshops.

Amazing work!!

- ASG community building got a boost from last week’s event
  - Planning with HS on organising regular “meet-up” sessions for ASG PDRAs
  - HS was told by some PDRAs that they felt isolated with their projects from the rest of ASG, and we want to address that
  - Will investigate whether we can get budgets for reimbursed meals for monthly/quarterly social lunches
- JL is unavailable to help with SPARRA glossy so HS asked if I could help: realised that we can recycle lightning talk that other JLy gave at ASG event
- Started but didn’t advance with repurposing the sessions content for notes for white papers
- Had meeting with MC about impact measurement, spoke with JS and HR about their projects

---
- MS: Mar-Dec planning for community events and opportunities.
 - Firechat as external engagement and promotion of your work.
- Useful to create template for allowing different projects to create their glossy
- Request a community page via topdesk and ask for edit access from Kim.
- All these connections sound fantastic! Great work.
- A to Z for ASG!???

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

#### Whom did you help these past few weeks?

- Quite a few people, I hope, but can’t recall all instances at the moment.

#### Who helped you these past few weeks?

- HM and AY with organising ASG event
- MS and KW with tremendous advice and support for planning the sessions
- BM and JR for introducing me to the community at the ASG event
- All of panellists, chairs and speakers for making the event a success
- Everyone who joined the social lunch and shared their hobbies and interests

MS: 🎊 Brilliant updates.

#### What did you achieve?

- Quite a bit that I’m pleased with
  - The ASG event itself went well from a logistics PoV (with one tiny hiccup)
  - I got feedback from a couple of the speakers that they enjoyed the panels they were on
  - The lightning talks went smooooothly and speakers got to discuss their work in longer breakout sessions
- Following the event, I’ve had some discussions with people I met for the first time (including one longer conversation that will hopefully feed into the E&S white paper that came entirely from the 1:1 networking)

MS: All great feedback! So much to follow up on.

#### What did you struggle with?

- Staying on top of the E&S white paper itself

MS: Great! Put the templates online. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Resume work on the E&S white paper: need to restructure the schedule for one
  - Tomorrow morning
- Go over all the recordings of the ASG event sessions and make proper notes to put on GitHub
  - Sometime next week; should take a day in total
- Follow up with speakers who have not replied to ask about putting their talks on Zenodo
  - Reminders tomorrow morning
- Discuss ASGardian podcASG with BC
  - Sometime next week, if BC is available
- Will be attending the DT:UA meeting at the office on Tuesday

#### Where do you need feedback (where can I engage)?

### Check-in ritual

Overall doing well but a tad overwhelmed with wrapping up my PhD.
It’s affecting work a little and will for the next ten days or so, unfortunately.

The ASG event is shaping up well!
Comms have gone out and a few more have registered.
Reached out to some individuals from the community to test the waters of the proposed sessions and got positive feedback.

Thanks in particular to HM for help with the ASG event, to DC for an insightful discussion on measuring the health of communities and to KW for advice on how to conduct lightning talks.

- Spoke with Scivision community about presenting at third session of ASG event (they’re interested)
- Made possible connection between health and Digital Twins (see below)

**Challenging**

## 2022-01-25

[N.B.: Didn’t actively take notes in this meeting.]

- ASG-meeting went well!
- Set up a repo, created Slack channels, OverLeaf

**Recording processes, ideas, stories**

- Publishing them in TTW…
- e.g. SPARRA sensitive data: case study?
    - What are the exceptions for openness?
- Drive the writing of the processes, but don’t have to be the primary writer
    - Involve PIs and PDRAs


## 2022-01-11

**Check-in ritual**
- Reflected on finding my voice as CM over the break
    - I am glad to see that you could make some time on reflecting this. Looking forward to discussing this and see where I can support this iterative process. 
- Grateful to KW for help with goals
    - 🌸   

### Project-specific reflection

- Need to meet individual members of ASG to understand the community
    - Who among the core stakeholders you have not yet managed to meet? 
- Can identify connections once I speak to individual members
- “Nobody knows how this community-building looks like.” What are the needs? What are the connections that exist between teams?
  - I think many of us have the vision for ASG community and overview of how building them would look like. I hope discussion earlier in the week was useful, howeever, we should block a day to work on sketching out some concrete strategy and timeline to share them with others. This will help in communicating what we want to achieve and where we might be misaligned - which would be a place to further feedback and iteration, and especially for engagement.
- Documenting queries, create pathways
    - How can we work towards making them visible? 
- “Have I let the ASG PDRAs know what my agenda is beyond the white papers?”

#### Anything else

- Goals?
  - Will derive goals from the impact I want to have from the work I do
  - What will a successful ASG CM achieve?
  - Look at JD
  - Personal-professional goals
- ASG goal-setting workshop?


#### After meeting

- Open repository on processes of ASG community-drive white papers
  - Issues:
    - What is aim of the white papers?
    - Barriers/incentives
    - Authorship process
      - External contributors
