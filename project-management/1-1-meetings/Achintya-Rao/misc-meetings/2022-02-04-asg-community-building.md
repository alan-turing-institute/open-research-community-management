## Repositories

- Community:
    - All about the projects including 'white paper process'
- White Paper Template: 
    - All framework and recommendations that we wish to integrate
    - Developed in parallel with the first paper
- Clones of white paper templates for different projects

### ASG Community

- White papers and community building are interlinked

### White Paper Template 
- Can be used by those outside Turing, gathers evidence for its efficacy
    - Something I’m showcasing more openly, talking about it all the time, hope that the project members adopt it
    - A generic tool for anyone to build a comms package

# AI for Science and Government (ASG) Community and Collaboration Initiative
---

Welcome to the community repository for the [AI for Science and Government  (ASG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) integrated research programme at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)! 🎉


## Vision

*Demonstrate, showcase and amplify the real-world impact of ASG research.*

## Mission

Engage ASG researchers to showcase their work, collaborate across the programme and exchange knowledge through a *Community of Practice*.

Our goal is to produce a series of communication outputs, including formal reports as well as impact stories, highlighting:
 
- the research contribution of the ASG programme,
- the unique role ASG plays in cultivating diverse endeavours and
- the influence of Turing’s network-convening capability ASG's work.

## Background and Motivation

AI for Science and Government (ASG) at the Alan Turing Institute is a major integrated research programme with a goal to deploy AI and data science in priority areas to support the UK economy. 
ASG was initiated in 2018 with a £38.8M investment from the UK government's strategic priorities fund.

ASG supports a range of ongoing projects in different domain areas including applications within the Criminal Justice System, Health, Data Science for Science, Engineering, and Urban Analytics.
In addition to these themes, ASG researchers are also working on three large cross-theme projects that focus on:

-   [Shocks and Resilience](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/shocks-and-resilience): improving policy-making by linking healthcare and economic data and models, preparing for future shocks and making government more resilient.
-   [Ecosystems of Digital Twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ecosystems-digital-twins): combining methodology from Engineering and Urban Analytics to develop integrated systems of digital twins.
-   [Environment and Sustainability](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/environment-and-sustainability): linking heterogeneous environmental data and models to help assess the widespread impact of climate change, from arctic sea ice loss to food security.

## About the project

In this project, we are producing a series of influential communication outputs, including community reports.
These address key issues for policy-makers and other stakeholders on the future of AI in science and government.
The documents are being co-created by all members of the ASG community and shared openly for further development and reuse.

One of the primary outcomes will be a portfolio of three community-written white papers, which will offer an opportunity for ASG as a programme to reflect on:

- learnings using evidence from ASG research,
- key challenges that have emerged,
- recommendations for the future, and
- possible calls-to-action for the wider research community, government, policymakers and the public.

The titles of these papers and associated communication materials will be defined by three **Core Groups** focusing on:
 
1. using data science to predict and protect from future societal shocks
2. Digital Twins as a revolution in engineering and beyond
3. the role of AI in creating a healthy, sustainable, environment and responding to climate change

Beyond the white papers, we will also use different models of communication such as data visualisation, illustrations, executable code, storytelling approaches, impact reports, case studies, podcasts, video recordings and follow-on technical papers.
These resources will pull together the different strands of ASG research and be easily digestible and accessible to a wide audience.

:speaker: Communication channels and pathways
---

We will use four channels for communication:

1. **GitHub repository**: 
    - About: This repository is used for sharing updates and resources crucial for enabling community collaboration, transparent communication and project management.
    - Access: Shared openly under CC-BY 4.0 License 
1. **Turing Slack Workspace**: 
   - About: For day-to-day communication, we will use the Slack channel: [#asg-members](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/asg-members). For White Paper related conversations, please use [#asg-white-papers](https://alan-turing-institute.slack.com/messages/asg-white-papers).
   - Access: The Turing members have access by default. External contributors should contact Achintya to be added by invitation.
1. **Overleaf**:
    - About: We have selected Overleaf as the authoring platform for co-developing the white papers as it is approved by the Turing data protection and the Legal team.
    - Access: All contributors will be added to the team account. Please contact Achintya if you are a contributor and have not received access.

The ASG programme is under the leadership of:

- **Professor Jonathan Rowe**, AI for Science and Government Programme Chair, Programme Director for Data Science for Science, and Turing Fellow and
- **Professor Ben MacArthur**, Director of AI for Science and Government, Deputy Programme Director for Health and Medical Sciences, and Turing Fellow
- [Check who else should be added]
 
-  Partners and projects involved (and link to a full document)
    - The Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) programme at the Turing represents a cross-cutting set of initiatives which seek to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all, and to empower a global, decentralised network of people who connect data with domain experts.
    - The Turing Way is an open source community-driven guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science. The project goal is to provide all the information that data scientists in academia, industry, government and the third sector need at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce and reuse at the end.
