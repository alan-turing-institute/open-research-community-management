# 1. Code of Conduct for the Open Research Community Building Team

> _A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms, rules, and responsibilities or proper practices of an individual party or an organization._

This Code of Conduct document outlines our expectations for 
participants within the team as well as this online repository (project).
We also provide steps to reporting any concern, uncomfortable situation 
or unacceptable behaviour by other participants. 
We are committed to providing a welcoming, collaborative and inspiring experience 
for all and expect our code of conduct to be honoured.

## 2. Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 3. Restorative Practice

We want to establish a Code of Conduct that focuses on creating a welcoming and safe environment for
everyone involved.
If a participant does not abide by the Code of Conduct, we will use the 
“restorative practices” approach to handle the situation. Restorative Practices has 
their roots in “restorative justice,” a way of looking at wrongdoing that focuses on 
repairing the harm done to people and the relationships rather than on punishing offenders or wrongdoer. 

## 4. Our Commitments

- 4.1 **Be friendly and patient.**

- 4.2 **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a project and community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
  members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration
  status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
  gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
  religion, and mental and physical ability.

- 4.3 **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions. Remember that we're an open source project. This means that contributors
  might not be communicating in their primary language.

- 4.4 **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a project where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

- 4.5 **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do
  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
  behaviour aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to Violent
  threats or language directed against another person, Discriminatory jokes and
  language, Posting sexually explicit or violent material, Posting (or
  threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information
  (“doxing”), Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms,
  Unwelcome sexual attention, Advocating for or encouraging, any of the above
  behaviour, and Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
  stop, then stop.

- 4.6 **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time. We must resolve disagreements
  and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity
  contributes to the strength of our work, which is composed of people from
  a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on
  issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
  that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each
  other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and
  learning from mistakes.
 
## 5. Our Standards

**5.1** Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

1. Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
1. Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
1. Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback
1. Accepting responsibility for harm done to people/community, correcting our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience to avoid future harm
1. Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community in the long term

**5.2** Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

1. Trolling or insulting people in any interaction (online or in person)

## 6. Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a project
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a member has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination
based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
disabilities.

## 7. Restorative Practice Statement and Principles

Restorative practices are based on the belief that human beings are happier, more 
cooperative and productive, and more likely to make positive changes in their behaviour 
when those in positions of authority do things with them, rather than to them or for them. 
The most critical function of restorative practices is restoring and building relationships. 
People in charge must meet with those they have wronged, explore what happened, 
and make necessary amends.

## 8. Restorative Practice Principles in this Code of Conduct

1. Focuses on harms rather than the intention of wrongdoers.
2. Prioritises persons affected and the consequent needs of victims and safety in communities.
3. Addresses obligations of the wrongdoer resulting from those harms, as well as the team/community’s obligations to both victims and wrongdoers.
4. Creates opportunity for all individuals, who have a legitimate stake in a given situation, to be heard and their concerns addressed.
5. Seeks to right the wrongs that have been done so that victims feel safe and valued, and wrongdoers feel restored to the team/community
6. Uses inclusive, collaborative processes giving fair opportunity to right the wrongs.

## 9. Restorative Disciplines

1. Acknowledges that trust, safe space and relationships are central to community building.
2. Must establish policies and procedures that handle incident reports in a way that strengthens relationships.
3. Focuses on harms done rather than rules broken.
4. Gives voice to the person who has been harmed.
5. Engages in collaborative problem solving
6. Empowers change and growth for all involved.
7. Enhances responsibility for actions and attitudes of all involved

The goals of these restorative practices are that Open Research Community Building Team 
would create a safe, friendly and enjoyable space for collaboration and support.
Together we strive to foster an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and included.

## 10. Scope

**10.1** This Code of Conduct applies to all members participating in the activities,

Specifically, our Code of Conduct applies to any conduct:
- in interactions within the team/community
- at any team activity, communication or event
- outside the team activity when a team member is representing projects associated with the team
- by members outside the team engaging on the Open Community Building GitHub repository.

**10.2** This Code of Conduct also applies to
individuals officially representing the community in public spaces.

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,

a representative at an online or offline event.

**10.3** This Code of Conduct also applies to individuals engaging with this repository 

for instance, in interactions on GitHub issues and Pull Requests or activities taking 
place in the context of the **Open Research Community Building Team**.

## 11. Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective, restorative and 
action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## 12. Enforcement

Instances of trolling, harassing, abusive, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour should be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.
If noticed by community leaders, incidents should be recorded and shared with one or more 
members of the Open Research Community Building Team for transparency.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
Together we strive to foster an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and included.

## 13. Reporting Incident

**13.1** Code of Conduct Contact for Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please report it 
by contacting the Team Lead, Malvika Sharan (email: msharan@turing.ac.uk). Malvika may involve
the Tools, Practices and Systems Programme Director, Kirstie Whitaker when incidents are perceived 
as difficult (not straightforward) except when any potential conflict of interest may arise.

To report an issue involving the team lead, please email directly to the Tools, Practices and Systems 
Programme Director, Kirstie Whitaker (currently on maternity leave). 

**13.2** In your report please include:

- Your contact information.

- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what
  occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
  available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please
  include a link.

- Any additional information that may be helpful.

**13.3** Confidentiality of Reporter(s)

We will respect the confidentiality of reporter(s) all the time to protect individuals who have been harmed.
In case the reporter's identity can not be hidden (if easily identified through the details of the report), the person handling the Code of Conduct report will discuss the possible ways to protect reporters from future incidents.

## 14. Terminology

* **14.1** Reporter: Person reporting an incident.
* **14.2** Reportee: Person being reported.

## 15. Report Handling and Enforcement

After receiving a report, the community leaders (or person handling the report), team lead or programme director, in this case, will review the incident report and follow this process to determine the cause and consequences that violated this Code of Conduct and take further actions:

### **15.1** If the breach is considered within the scope of this Code of Conduct

Community leaders will reach out to the reporter to ask for further information if the submitted report is not complete or needs some additional context.
Community leaders will also ensure that person impacted or harmed by the reported incident is safe and identify how they can be further supported.

**15.1.1** A meeting with the reportee will be scheduled where the person handling the report will discuss four questions:
- What happened?
- What were you thinking at the time?
- Who has been affected by what you have done? In what way?
- What do you think you need to do to make things right?
- Knowing what you know, what would you have done differently?

**15.1.2** When the incident in question inflicted harm on another person, additional 
questions will be asked on behalf of the person(s) harmed:
- What did you think when you realized what had happened?
- What impact has this incident had on you and others?
- What do you think needs to happen to make things right?

The person handling the report may follow up with reportee or reporter after this discussion 
with any additional questions to help them reach a resolution.

### **15.2** If the breach is considered outside the scope of this Code of Conduct

### **15.2.1** If the reportee is an employee of the Turing 

Code of Conduct should be considered as a norm-setting mechanism for the Open Research Community Building Team before any involvement of HR in the interactions that take place within the team. 

If the reportee is the Turing Staff, for instance, Community Managers and senior researchers, and the incident is considered out of the scope of this Code of Conduct due to the severity of the matter/case, an HR process (formal or informal), will be started.
In this case, the report will be passed to the HR and/or appropriate personnel under the Turing policies and their policy related enforcement mechanism will take precedent over the Code of Conduct enforcement.

All the Turing employees have the obligation to read and understand the staff policies, which include:

### **15.2.2** If the reportee is not the Turing Employee
- an appropriate authority or law enforcement mechanism will be identified who can respond to the reported incident with the appropriate action.

## 16. Resolutions for reports in the scope of this Code of Conduct

Here are examples of possible resolutions to a report. 
This list is not comprehensive, and any action necessary to reach a fair resolution will be taken as needed. 
Possible resolutions to an incident include:

1. a private communication from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behaviour was inappropriate.
1. an apology to the person harmed or the team/community as a whole - this will be done via the person handling the report
1. an action plan for the reportee to improve their awareness and correct future behaviours
1. reportee will have no interaction with the reporter, mediating interaction between reporter and reportee is not in scope of this Code of Conduct
1. reportee will have no unsolicited interaction with reporter (in rare cases, when reporter is not anonymous) and those enforcing the Code of Conduct. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media.
1. not publishing the content (code, documents, media or other materials) that violated the Code of Conduct, until necessary changes have been made and agreed upon by the person handling the report.
1. An imposed suspension, such as asking reportee to “take a week or month off” from the GitHub repo or team activity.
1. recommended training activity relevant to correcting the behaviour or building awareness/understanding required to right the wrongs.
1. a stronger warning with consequences for continued behaviour. 

**16.1** After the Resolution is Agreed Upon

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the person handling the report will contact the reporter and any other affected parties to explain the proposed resolution. 
They will ask if this resolution is acceptable and must note feedback for the record. However, they are not required to act on this feedback.

The reportee will be contacted via email informing them of the resolution.
A final meeting may be conducted if necessary.

The person handling the report will maintain records of all reports so that they may be reviewed if stronger measures are required when repeated violations occur by the same individual as well as to improve our Code of Conduct for future participation.

## 17. Conflict of Interest

All reports will be kept confidential with details shared only with people involved in report handling. 
If a person handling the report (team lead or programme director) is linked with the ongoing issue, they will declare their Conflict of Interest and remove themselves from any discussion related to the report handling.
Resolution action may also include identifying appropriate members from within the Open Research Community Building Team if more support for the person handling the report is needed.
