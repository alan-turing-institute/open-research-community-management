# **Work in Progress** Sunsetting Documentation audit

*This issue should be created by RCMs when a project (or the RCM involvement in a project) is coming to an end. It should be used in conjunction with the [sunsetting workflow (WIP)](~/resources/sunsetting/RCM-sunsetting.drawio.pdf). For each item, identify where the appropriate documentation is, and what is incomplete or not applicable. The team can then use the outcome of this audit to prioritise activities. Ensure that access to any infrastructure described is not relient on a closed institutional mechanisms or approval. Aim for all documentation to be doi'd (versioned) with contributors acknowledged.*
