## How to make videos

### Using Turing comms team
* Contact Turing comms team to get professional video production - contact is Dan Whitfield or Sian Fortt. 

### Making your own video - general guidance
* See the [recording tips guide from ELIXIR-UK](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building/blob/video-resources-docs/resources/videos/recording-tips.md)

### Recording tools/software
* Link to [SSI fellowship video recording guide](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/2022/application-video-guide) - using OBS studio and Zoom.
* [Recording in powerpoint](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building/blob/video-resources-docs/resources/videos/how-to-record-powerpoint-windows.pdf) - by ELIXIR-UK.
* [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/?sdid=SL4KM9XN&mv=search&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCaOkz_ueKsN_5a6bps292Zt68BgNBDFTuB46uss9MpkryzbNR5cC7kaAgV3EALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!589020195299!p!!g!!express%20adobe!16624093353!135127940375) is a free video editor that lets you add some simple effects. However you can only edit the video in 30 second intervals so this will not be useful for long videos!

### Making videos accessible
All videos should have captions to make them more accessible and you should also think about the colours you use and the size of the font. You could also make captions in different languages, especially if your community is global. 

#### General tips are:
* **Make text and important visuals big enough** to be read even from the back of the room or easily on the screen.
* **Use an easy-to-read font face** - Simple fonts with consistent thickness are often easier to read from a distance. Fonts where parts of the letters are thin are harder to read. Avoid fancy fonts that are difficult to read.
* **Use sufficient contrast between colors** (“luminance contrast”)
* **Consider how to use motion or animations** - some animations can be too distracting.
* **Make presentation/video material accessible** - as well as the video itself, make the slides and script accessible under open license.
